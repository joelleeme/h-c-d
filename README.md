# Histopathologic Cancer Detection
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Histopathologic Cancer Detection project. The goal of this project is to develop models to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. This project is part of a Kaggle competition.

## Project Overview
In this project, we explored three different model architectures:
1. Simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
2. Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
3. Transfer Learning using ResNet50

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of pathology images and their corresponding labels indicating the presence of metastatic cancer. The train and test datasets are provided by Kaggle.

## Repository Structure
`Histopathologic_Cancer_Detection.ipynb`: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with the analysis.
